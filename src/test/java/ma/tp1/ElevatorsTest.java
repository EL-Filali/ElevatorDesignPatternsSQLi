/**
 *
 * This test is about a building having several elevators with different states.
 * For example, each elevator can be at a different level, and can be going up,
 * or down.
 * </p>
 * 
 * The objective of this exercise is to write a program that will identify which
 * elevator will be served once a request for an elevator is registered.
 dq* </p>
 * 
 * Please note these rules : </br>
 *      - An elevator is requested by default from <b>top</b> floor. </br>
 *      - An elevator can be resting at a given floor, going up or going down. </br>
 *      - An elevator switch automatically his direction when reaching the edges of
 * the building (means the first and top floors). </br>
 *      - An elevator can not switch his direction in the middle of a building.
 * Example: in a building of 10 floors, an elevator at the 3rd floor and
 * ascending can never go down before reaching the 10th floor. And vice
 * versa.</br>
 *      - An elevator is never in between floors.
